  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="about-box">
    <p>Hi, I'm Alain! I'm a self-driven and detail-oriented aspiring software developer with a deep interest in web technologies. I love building clean, responsive websites that are not only functional but also enjoyable to use.</p>
    <p>I began my journey in tech by exploring HTML and CSS, and quickly expanded my skills into JavaScript and Python. I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and bringing creative ideas to life through design and logic.</p>
    <p>I'm currently studying at African Leadership University and actively learning full-stack development, version control (Git & GitHub), and collaborative project work. I'm especially passionate about using technology to empower youth and improve local communities.</p>
    <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy sports, music, and exploring innovative ideas that push boundaries.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>

    </li>

      <p>At La Colombière, I built a strong foundation in academics and extracurriculars. The school emphasized critical thinking, creativity, and service.</p>
      <p>This is where I first discovered my passion for technology and problem-solving.</p>

    </li>
    <li>

      <p>I was introduced to coding and software development here.</p>
      <p>It’s one of Rwanda’s most prestigious high schools.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>African Leadership University</strong> – ALU2027</p>

      <p>I'm proud to be part of such a bold, visionary institution.</p>
